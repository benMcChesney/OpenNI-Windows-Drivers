READ ME!

If you are reading this it means you want to use a kinect perihpereal camera with your PC!

If you have an issue installing at any point or something doesn't work, be sure to disable and remove all drivers and try reinstalling.

This was testing on Windows 64 - Bit but it should also work on windows 32bit as well.
All the drivers package are probably updated on the openNI.org website but these are gaurenteed to work!
The kinect mod driver was created by avin2 ( https://github.com/avin2 ) 
With all of these installations be sure to have UAW turned off or run them as an administrator or they may not install correctly.

1. Install OpenNI >>> the file name is "OpenNI-Bin-Win32-v1.0.0.25.exe"

2. Install NITE >>> the file name is "NITE-Bin-Win32-v1.3.0.18.exe"
You will need to use the open-source license key that is included in a .txt file in this folder.

3. Install the modified windows drivers for the Kinect:
	execute "dpinst-amd64.exe" for 64 bit windows
	execute "dpinst-x86.exe" for 32 bit

4. Run SensorKinect-Win32-5.0.0.exe and run it.

5. To test that is is working try out the openNI samples in 
C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenNI\Samples\Bin\Release\NIUserTracker.exe
